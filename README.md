This is the README of the Antz project.


Technology
==========

* python (http://python.org/) – programming language
* pygame (http://pygame.org/) – for the rendering
* pgu (http://www.pygame.org/projects/9/108/) – for adding UI controls
* py2exe (http://www.py2exe.org/) – to create an exe for the teacher

(pgu and py2exe have to be tested first)


Why pygame
==========

We prefer pygame over the intended HTML5 (JavaScript) libraries because it's just faster. We did a small test which rendered 10'000 moving sprites. This renders just fine in pygame, but not in any of the tested HTML5 engines. 

And again we choose Python over Java because pygame seems to be a really nice (although a little old) framework for building games.
